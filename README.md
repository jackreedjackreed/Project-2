## Description
As users who love to read and expand their knowledge. We want users to be able to come to a website that they are happy to share their thoughts and experiences with the books they have either read or are currently reading. Users are able to discuss with their club members with their either personalized club name of their choosing or with our random club name generator that populates a fun little club name for those who want a jazzy name but cannot exactly pin point the name you wanted to be called collectively. They have the option to have one created for their personalized book club.
